🧰 Tech Stack
1. Tech	Purpose
2. HTML	Structure of the stopwatch
3. CSS	Styling and layout
4. JavaScript	Timer logic, event handling, and interactivity

⚙️ How It Works
1. The stopwatch uses Date.now() to capture the start time and calculates the elapsed time in real-time using setInterval.
2. The display is updated every 10 milliseconds to show minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
3. Lap times can be recorded and are displayed in a scrollable list.
4. The interface includes four main buttons
