# SCT_WD_2
Interactive and user friendly stopwatch web application. implement functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch as well as trapping and displaying the lap times , user can accurately measures and record time intervals.

📚 What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
How to use setInterval and Date.now() to measure time in JavaScript.
How to manipulate the DOM to update content dynamically
Creating a responsive and styled layout with CSS
Handling user events (like button clicks)
Managing time calculations and formatting

🧰 Tech Stack
Tech	Purpose
HTML	Structure of the stopwatch
CSS	Styling and layout
JavaScript	Timer logic, event handling, and interactivity

⚙️ How It Works
The stopwatch uses Date.now() to capture the start time and calculates the elapsed time in real-time using setInterval.
The display is updated every 10 milliseconds to show minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
Lap times can be recorded and are displayed in a scrollable list.
The interface includes four main buttons
Start: Begins the stopwatch
Pause: Freezes the time
Lap: Records the current time without pausing
Reset: Clears everything back to zero
